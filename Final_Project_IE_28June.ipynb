        "### In my project, I encountered several types of errors in the dataset, such as irrelevant text segments like credits and breaks, unnecessary square brackets, as well as punctuation and formatting inconsistencies. These issues were problematic because they could introduce noise and distort the natural language patterns I aim to analyze. To address these concerns, I implemented a cleanup function that systematically removed irrelevant segments, normalized punctuation, and standardized formatting across the dataset. This cleanup process was crucial to ensure that NLP models receive clean and consistent input, thereby improving it's ability to accurately analyze and extract meaningful insights from the text. After applying the cleanup function, I observed significant reductions in the impurity scores of some rows (which were initially uncleaned), indicating that the text became cleaner and more suitable for further analysis. Additionally, I created a new column, 'Cleaned_Subtitle,' to store the cleaned text, facilitating easy access to the processed data for subsequent pipeline stages like extracting the named entities, attributes and getting a knowledge graph. **Removing errors and inconsistencies improves the quality of text analysis, enhances model performance, and facilitates better insights and interpretations from the data**. This approach ultimately supports the overall goals of the project by ensuring that the processed text is as clear and meaningful as possible."

Monica: Look I\\'m sorry guys I just don\\'t wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have Chandler: Yes and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child\\'s pillow Phoebe: Monica Hi! Um Monica you\\'re scaring me I mean you\\'re like you\\'re like all chaotic and twirly And notnot in a good way Joey: Yeah calm down You don\\'t see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come Monica: That\\'s because as far as my parents are concerned Ross can do no wrong Y\\'see he\\'s the Prince Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born Chandler: Ew ew ew ew ew ew ew ew!

Ross: Yeah Mrs Geller: Oh we\\'re having spaghetti! That\\'s easy Monica: I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish but were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me Mrs Geller: What that Rachel did to her life We ran into her parents at the club they were not playing very well Mr Geller: I\\'m not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding but forty thousand dollars is a lot of money! Mrs Geller: Well at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar Monica: What\\'s that supposed to mean? Mrs Geller: Nothing! It\\'s an expression Monica: No it\\'s not Mr Geller: Don\\'t listen to your mother You\\'re independent and you always have been! Even when you were a kid and you were chubby and you had no friends you were just fine! And you would read alone in your room and your puzzles Mr Geller: Look there are people like Ross who need to shoot for the stars with his museum and his papers getting published Other people are satisfied with staying where they are I\\'m telling you these are the people who never get cancer Mr Geller: And I read about these women trying to have it all and I thank God \\'Our Little Harmonica\\' doesn\\'t seem to have that problem Monica: So Ross what\\'s going on with you? Any stories? No news no little anecdotes to share with the folks? Ross: Okay!

        "#### Snorkel is a tool that helps create labeled data for training machine learning models without requiring a lot of manual work. I've written code to process pairs of subtitles where each pair typically contains dialogues between two people. First, I split each subtitle into segments based on who's speaking (Person1 and Person2). Then, I tokenize these segments into smaller units like words. For each segment, I locate where Person1 and Person2 are mentioned and record their positions. Additionally, I extract the words between Person1 and Person2, as well as the words that follow each person's mention (extracting rows with 'Ross' as Person1 or Person2). If any errors occur during this process, I handle them by setting the affected values to empty lists. Finally, I remove any rows that contain missing values to ensure the data is clean and complete."

This involved identifying negative sentiments between person mentions (lf_opponents) and to their left (lf_opponents_left_window), as well as positive sentiments between person mentions (lf_ally_relationship) and to their left (lf_ally_left_window). For instance, I focused on rows where lf_opponents flagged instances of negative sentiments, such as in the sentence \"Ross: You look great I uh I hate that Carol: Sorry You look good too\", where the presence of \"hate\" indicates a negative sentiment expressed between the individuals. This approach helps analyze and label relationships based on the sentiment conveyed in the subtitles."

In addition to the in built named entities, two new custom entities have been added to the nlp pipeline namely, beverages and emotion.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 2. The **analysis highlighted both positive and negative relationships between entities**. For instance, words associated with negative sentiments (like hate, fear) were often found between mentions of individuals, indicating potential conflicts or tensions. Conversely, positive sentiment words (like happy, love) appeared in contexts suggesting supportive or affectionate relationships.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 3. The **co-occurrence graph visually represented how frequently different entities appeared together in the text**. It showed clusters of closely connected nodes (mostly 'person' entity), indicating strong associations or thematic links between entities. This could reflect recurring themes or recurring interactions among characters or topics.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### The process of extracting information from the text revealed a web of relationships and themes, showing how different characters and elements interact and appear together. **To deepen this understanding further, I could expand my analysis by including more types of objects, events, or cultural references that are relevant to the story. Additionally, integrating sentiment analysis would help measure the emotional tones linked with each interaction among characters.** This approach would give us a clearer view of how characters' emotions and relationships shape the storyline, making it easier to interpret and understand the text's overall meaning."
